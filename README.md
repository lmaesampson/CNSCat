# Project Overview:
Given clinical data from approximately 400 children in a Ugandan hospital, we explore if a trained classifier can improve diagnostic accuracy above that of trained experts. We look at decision trees and Bayesian logistic regression as two methods to compare.

We also explore this problem as one of assessing different operational strategies. Is it 'best' to follow doctor's best guesses, the output of our classifier, or simply to treat all of the children with all available medications at intake?
